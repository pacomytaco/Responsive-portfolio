        <img src="assets\images\THE BEAR.jpg" alt="Sky with bear Statue" class="auth-image">

        <p> I was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico where I lived for three years before moving to Ohio.
                Growing up as an only child, I was surrounded by animals on a small farm in Moreland Hills where I learned to handle horses.
                In 2014 I graduated high school and soon after attended Case Western for one year before transferring to John Carroll. 
                I attended JCU for another year before deciding to take time off to actually figure out what I am going to do with my life. 
                During this time, I worked at Beachwood Mall for about 8 months before finding a job with Stachowski Alpacas and Stachowski Farm, Inc.
                Working with the alpacas is definetly the best job I have had hands down. However, it is just not practical if I want to actually become my own successful, independent person. 
                This has led me to explore other educational options aside from a four year college which is when I discovered Case Coding Bootcamp. 
                I quickly signed up and soon discovered just how mindblowing the world of programming actually is.
